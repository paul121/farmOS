# API

farmOS provides an API that other applications/systems can use to read and
write records via HTTP requests.

The root API endpoint is `/api`.

farmOS adheres to the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification, and
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is used to describe the available API
resources.

To begin exploring the farmOS API schema, visit `/api/schema`. From there, you
